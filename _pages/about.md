I am a second year master student from [Faculty of Mathematics](https://www.uni-regensburg.de/mathematics/faculty/home/index.html), [University of Regensburg](https://www.uni-regensburg.de/). My research interests includes Diophantine Geometry, Arakelov Geometry and post quantum cryptograph. Prior to this, I completed my bachelor's degree in mathematics at the [Southern University of Science and Technology](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/)(SUSTech) in Shenzhen, China.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Dr. Klaus KÃ¼nnemann](https://www.uni-regensburg.de/mathematik/mathematik-kuennemann/startseite/index.html) as I purse my research at the University of Regensburg.
